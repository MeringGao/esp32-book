# impl Rust for ESP32

In this book, we use the ESP32 DevKit v1 with Rust to build simple and fun projects. The ESP32 is a popular microcontroller for IoT applications, and we take a hands-on approach to help you learn by doing. You will explore how to turn on an LED when the room gets darker using an LDR, use an ultrasonic sensor to detect when something is close, control an LED through Wi-Fi, draw images/text on an OLED display, play songs and alarm sound with a buzzer, control a servo motor, and more.

## Prerequisites
If you haven't already read the ["The Rust on ESP Book"](https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/introduction.html), I highly recommend doing so first. While this book will cover some aspects of setting up the development environment and basic concepts, it will not go into as much detail to avoid unnecessary repetition, as these topics are already thoroughly explained in the official book.

## Meet the Hardware
We will be using one of the development board "ESP32 DevKit V1", which comes with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, along with an integrated RF module
